Game Description:

Embark on an enchanting adventure in "Fairy Treasure Quest," where you guide a brave little fairy through magical forests and mysterious ocean depths in search of hidden treasures. The journey is fraught with challenges, but with determination and skill, the fairy can overcome every obstacle in her path.

Gameplay Overview:

Forest Mode:
Begin your adventure in the lush, mystical forest. Here, the fairy hasn't yet unlocked her magical powers and must rely on her agility to dodge obstacles like enchanted branches and swiftly moving sprites. Use the arrow keys to maneuver the fairy, avoiding collisions to score points. Each time the fairy passes through a pair of branches, you earn 1 point. Be cautious—any contact with obstacles ends the forest mode, displaying your final score. Afterward, you can choose to restart the forest mode to improve your score or advance to the next stage.

Ocean Mode:
After conquering the forest, the fairy gains the ability to cast magic spells. Enter the ocean depths, where the remaining time to explore starts at 60 seconds, with bonus time added based on your score from the forest. Navigate through the underwater world using the arrow keys and defend yourself with magical energy balls by pressing the spacebar. In this mode, your score depends on defeating enemies: each small creature is worth 1 point, while vanquishing a mighty dragon earns you 5 points. However, dragons are tough to beat, requiring three hits to defeat while they relentlessly attack with fireballs. As you explore, look for the rare sun symbol, which grants an extra life when touched. Survive until the time runs out to claim the treasure; otherwise, you'll only keep the points you've earned.

The longer you survive, the more enemies you can defeat, and the higher your score will climb. Strategize by accumulating points in Forest Mode to gain additional time for the Ocean Mode, giving you a better chance to find the hidden treasure. Choose wisely and enjoy the adventure!
